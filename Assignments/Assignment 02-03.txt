4) Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
ans) It is not possible to see the “first five rows” of a table because a table in a relational database 
     has no built-in or guaranteed ordering of rows. Tables represent unordered sets of records, 
     so there is no concept of “first” or “last” rows unless an order is explicitly specified.
     The relational model (ANSI SQL standard) treats a table as a set, and sets do not preserve order.
     The database engine may store and retrieve rows in any physical order depending on indexing, storage, or optimization.
     Therefore, asking for “first 5 rows” only makes sense after defining how rows should be ordered.
