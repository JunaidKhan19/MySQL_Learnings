Assignment 05

1) Write a query that will give you all orders for more than Rs. 1,000.
select onum, amt, odate, cnum, snum from orders where amt > 1000;

2) Write a query that will give you the names and cities of all salespeople in London with a commission above .10.
select sname, city from salespeople where city = "London" and comm > .10;

3) Write a query on the Customers table whose output will exclude all customers with a rating <= 100, unless they are located in Rome.
select cnum, cname, city, rating, snum from customers where rating > 100 or city = "Rome";

4) What will be the output from the following query?
Select * from Orders
where (amt < 1000 OR
NOT (odate = ‘1990-10-03’
AND cnum > 2003));

ans) the output will show all the rows that satisfies either of the condition
	i) if amount is less than 1000
	ii) if orderdate is 1990-10-03 and customers number is 2003.
so the query first checks the orders date if it is on 1990-10-03 then if it is on the date so the cnum should be 2003 or less than it.
if this is satisfied then checks for amount if the value is less than 1000, If value exceeds the amount in query but order date is 1990-10-03 with cnum 2003 then it is included.  
hence orders on '1990-10-03' with a cnum greater than 2003 and amount ≥ 1000 are only excluded.

5) What will be the output of the following query?
Select * from Orders
where NOT ((odate = ‘1990-10-03’ OR snum
>1006) AND amt >= 1500);

ans) the statement first checks if the order is on date 1990-10-03 or the snum is greater than 1006; either one
then checks if amount is greater than or equal to 1500.
if the combined value is (odate 1990-10-03 & amt >= 1500) or (snum > 1006 & amt >= 1500) then the query isn't selecting that row

The query excludes all orders where the amount is ≥ 1500 and either the order date is 1990-10-03 or the salesperson number (snum) is greater than 1006.
All other rows are selected.


6) What is a simpler way to write this query?
Select snum, sname, city, comm From Salespeople where (comm > .12 OR comm <.14);

ans) Select snum, sname, city, comm From Salespeople where comm between .12 and .14;
