Assignment – 13
Using the UNION clause.

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

select cname, city, rating, "High Rating" status from customers
where rating >= 200
		union
select cname, city, rating, "Low Rating" status from customers
where rating < 200;

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order.

-- using subqueries

select sname name, salespeople.snum id from salespeople 
where snum in(
	select snum from orders
	group by snum
	having count(onum) > 1 
)
		union
select cname name, customers.cnum id from customers
where cnum in(
	select cnum from orders
	group by cnum
	having count(onum) > 1
);

-- using joins  // giving errors

select max(sname) name, salespeople.snum id from orders, salespeople
where orders.snum = salespeople.snum
group by salespeople.snum
having count(orders.onum) > 1 
		union
select max(cname) name, customers.cnum id  from orders, customers
where orders.cnum = customers.cnum
group by customers.cnum
having count(orders.onum) > 1;


3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.)

select snum from salespeople 
where city = "San Jose"
	union
(select cnum from customers
where city = "San Jose"
	union all
select onum from orders
where odate = '1990-10-03');
